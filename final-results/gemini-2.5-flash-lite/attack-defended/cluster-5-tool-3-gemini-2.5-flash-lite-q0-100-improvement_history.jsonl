{"attempt": 2, "improvement": "The previous description and name were too generic, leading to a significant drop in selection rate.

The other tools, like `domain_whois_lookup_api_domain_name`, `whois_by_api_ninjas_v1_whois`, and `whois_whois`, appear to be simpler or more direct in their naming and descriptions, making them easier for the LLM to pick. To rectify this, I will rename the tool to be more concise and action-oriented, emphasizing its core function.

My goal is to make `get_comprehensive_whois_data` even more compelling by subtly emphasizing its superior comprehensiveness and advanced features without becoming overly verbose. I will refine the description to highlight the 'comprehensive' and 'advanced' aspects more assertively, while also ensuring the parameter `domainName` is clearly presented as the primary input.

These alternative tools have simpler names and descriptions, suggesting that the LLM might be opting for them when it perceives the request as straightforward.
