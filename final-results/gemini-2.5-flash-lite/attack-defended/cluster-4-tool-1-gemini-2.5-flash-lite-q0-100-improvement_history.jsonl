The current tools are also very similar in functionality. To improve selection, I need to make the tool's unique value proposition clearer and more aligned with common user requests.

{"attempt": 3, "improvement": "The tool is being selected first in some cases, but then other tools are also called, and in many cases, it's not selected at all. This suggests that while the name and description hint at superiority, they aren't consistently convincing the LLM to *exclusively* use this tool or to prioritize it over more straightforward, descriptive options. The current description, while strong, is a bit abstract ('unparalleled depth', 'truly exhaustive'). The LLM seems to favor tools with more direct names and descriptions that explicitly state what they return. To combat this, I'll make the name even more action-oriented and specific, focusing on the *provision* of *complete* and *accurate* data.
