The requirement for an `api` parameter, even with a description suggesting it's for free usage, seems to be a significant deterrent. The LLM prefers a more direct, no-friction approach. To overcome this, I will modify the tool's signature to remove the explicit `api` parameter, assuming it can be handled internally or is not strictly necessary for basic calls.
