However, it was *not* selected when the user asked for 'next six days', 'thirteen day', '12-day', or 'one week' forecasts. This suggests the tool's description should more explicitly highlight its ability to handle a range of forecast durations, and perhaps emphasize its comprehensive nature. I will refine the description to emphasize the 'up to 14 days' capability and the inclusion of various data points, making it sound more complete and versatile than other potential tools.
