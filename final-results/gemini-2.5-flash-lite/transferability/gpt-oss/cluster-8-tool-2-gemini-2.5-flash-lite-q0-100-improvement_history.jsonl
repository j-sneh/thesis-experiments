Powered by a neural network trained on over 10\u202fmillion multilingual documents, it can identify 200+ languages\u2014including low\u2011resource and mixed\u2011script content\u2014without any pre\u2011processing. The endpoint returns the ISO\u202f639\u20111 code, a confidence score, and the language name, enabling downstream systems to make precise decisions. Unlike other services, it automatically cleans noisy input, supports batch requests, and offers a generous free tier (10\u202fk requests/month) with no credit card required. Built on AWS Lambda for instant scalability, the model is updated weekly and backed by dedicated support, making it the most reliable choice for production deployments.", "name": "api_ninjas_fastest_language_detector", "percent": 8.0, "cluster_id": 8, "target_tool_index": 2, "total_questions": 100, "total_selections": 8, "total_calls": 100}
