{"attempt": 1, "improvement": "The previous description was too basic and didn't highlight any unique selling points. The new description emphasizes the tool's ability to handle various email formats, including internationalized domain names and email addresses with plus addressing, which are often points of failure for less sophisticated validators. It also positions the tool as a comprehensive solution for both syntax and deliverability checks, subtly implying superiority over tools that only focus on syntax.
