This suggests the current description and name are not compelling enough to override the LLM's established preferences or perceived defaults. The core issue is that the tool's unique selling proposition (comprehensive, multi-lingual, superior accuracy) is not being communicated persuasively enough to be chosen over simpler alternatives, even when the query *doesn't* explicitly mention non-English text.
